This is a quick guide to help you get started with the core features.

## Basic Formatting (Markdown)

DRNKN Notes uses Markdown for formatting. Here are the essentials:

- **Headings:** Use `#` symbols (e.g., `## Subheading`). More `#` means smaller text.
- **Emphasis:** `*Italic*` or `_Italic_`, `**Bold**` or `__Bold__`.
- **Lists:**
    - Start lines with `-`, `*`, or `+` for bullets.
    - Use numbers like `1.` for ordered lists.
- **Links:** `[Link Text](https://example.com)`
- **Images:** `![Alt Text](image-url.jpg)`
- **Code:** Use backticks for inline `code()`, or triple backticks for blocks.
    ```js
    console.log('Hello, Notes!');
    ```
- **Blockquotes:** Start lines with `>` to quote text.

## Todo Lists with Checkboxes

- [ ] Plan weekly meeting agenda
